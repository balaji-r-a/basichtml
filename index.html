    <h5>What is front-end development in simple words?</h5>
    <p>A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applicationsâ€”the part users see
     and interact with. A front-end developer creates websites and applications using
     web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access 
     and interact with the site or app</p>
